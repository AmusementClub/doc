VSPipe
######

Synopsis
********

**vspipe** <script> <outfile> [options]

vspipe's main purpose is to evaluate VapourSynth scripts and output the
frames to a file.

If *outfile* is a hyphen (``-``), vspipe will write to the standard output.

If *outfile* is a dot (``.``), vspipe will do everything as usual, except it
will not write the video frames anywhere.


Options
*******

``-a, --arg key=value``
    Argument to pass to the script environment, it a key with this name and value (str typed) will be set in the globals dict

``-s, --start N``
    Set output frame range (first frame)
  
``-e, --end N``
    Set output frame range (last frame)

``-o, --outputindex N``
    Select output index

``-r, --requests N``
    Set number of concurrent frame requests

``-c, --container <y4m/wav/w64>``
    Add headers for the specified format to the output

``-t, --timecodes FILE``
    Write timecodes v2 file

``-p, --progress``
    Print progress to stderr
    
``--filter-time``
    Records the time spent in each filter and prints it out at the end of processing.

``-i, --info``
    Show video info and exit

``-g, --graph <simple/full>``
    Print output node filter graph in dot format to outfile and exit

``-v, --version``
    Show version info and exit


Examples
********

Show script info:
    ``vspipe --info script.vpy -``

Write to stdout:
    ``vspipe [options] script.vpy -``

Request all frames but don't output them:
    ``vspipe [options] script.vpy .``

Write frames 5-100 to file:
    ``vspipe --start 5 --end 100 script.vpy output.raw``

Pipe to x264 and write timecodes file:
    ``vspipe script.vpy - --y4m --timecodes timecodes.txt | x264 --demuxer y4m -o script.mkv -``

Pass values to a script:
    ``vspipe --arg deinterlace=yes --arg "message=fluffy kittens" script.vpy output.raw``

AVFS
####

AV FileSystem is based on `AVFS <https://turtlewar.org/avfs/>`_ and shares most of its
source code and functionality. This package has several uses. It can easily make
a script file openable by any application, as it appears like a real,
uncompressed avi file. It can also be used to bridge the 32/64 bit gap, since a
plain file can always be read.

To use it simply run ``avfs`` in the ``core32`` or ``core64`` directories with the script name as argument.
This will create a virtual file in ``C:\\Volumes``.

The *alt_output* argument of *set_output* is respected and can be used to get additional compatibility
with professional applications.

Avisynth Support
****************

Note that this AVFS version is also compatible with Avisynth 2.6 and Avisynth+. When using Avisynth+
higher bitdepth output is also supported. The easiest way to obtain a recent version is to extract
``avfs.exe`` from the portable VapourSynth archives.
